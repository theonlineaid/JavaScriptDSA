## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that help in organizing and processing data efficiently. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building optimized applications and performing well in technical interviews.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into DSA, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (variables, loops, functions, and objects).
- Familiarity with development tools (like Node.js, NPM, or any JavaScript environment).

## Key Concepts

Here are the main topics to focus on while learning DSA:

1. **Basic Data Structures**:
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Hash Tables

2. **Trees**:
   - Binary Trees
   - Binary Search Trees
   - Heaps (Min-Heap and Max-Heap)
   - Tree Traversal Techniques (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order)

3. **Graphs**:
   - Graph Representations (Adjacency List and Matrix)
   - Graph Traversal Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)

4. **Algorithms**:
   - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Recursion
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms

5. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Time Complexity (Big O Notation)
   - Space Complexity
