Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science that allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements. There are several types of linked lists, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Below are the main types of linked lists:

There are four basic forms of linked lists:

01. Singly linked lists
02. Doubly linked lists
03. Circular linked lists
04. Circular Doubly Linked List

Here’s a detailed overview of the different types of linked lists, including their structures, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.

## 1. Singly Linked List

### Structure:
- **Node Structure**: Each node contains two components:
  - **Data**: The value stored in the node.
  - **Pointer to Next Node**: A reference to the next node in the list.
  
```plaintext
Node
  ├── Data
  └── Pointer to Next Node
```

### Characteristics:
- **Unidirectional**: Traversal is possible only in one direction (from the head to the end).
- **Dynamic Size**: Size can grow or shrink as nodes are added or removed.
- **Efficient Insertion/Deletion**: These operations can be performed in O(1) time if the position is known (except for the search operation).

### Advantages:
- More memory-efficient compared to arrays, as it allocates memory as needed.
- No need to declare the size in advance.

### Disadvantages:
- Random access is not possible (must traverse from the head to access a node).
- Requires extra memory for pointers.

### Use Cases:
- Implementing stacks and queues.
- Applications where the number of elements is unknown or varies significantly.

### Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null; // Pointer to the next node
    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null; // Start of the list
    }

    append(data) {
        const newNode = new ListNode(data);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
    }

    display() {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current) {
            process.stdout.write(current.data + " -> ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        console.log("null");
    }
}
```

## 2. Doubly Linked List

### Structure:
- **Node Structure**: Each node contains three components:
  - **Data**: The value stored in the node.
  - **Pointer to Next Node**: A reference to the next node in the list.
  - **Pointer to Previous Node**: A reference to the previous node.

```plaintext
Node
  ├── Pointer to Previous Node
  ├── Data
  └── Pointer to Next Node
```

### Characteristics:
- **Bidirectional**: Traversal is possible in both directions (forward and backward).
- **More Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for the previous pointer.

### Advantages:
- Easier to delete a node given only a reference to it, as you can access the previous node.
- Supports more complex operations like reverse traversal.

### Disadvantages:
- Requires more memory than singly linked lists.
- More complex implementation due to handling two pointers per node.

### Use Cases:
- Implementing complex data structures like deques.
- Applications requiring frequent insertions and deletions from both ends of the list.

### Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
class DoublyListNode {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null; // Pointer to next node
        this.prev = null; // Pointer to previous node
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null; // Start of the list
    }

    append(data) {
        const newNode = new DoublyListNode(data);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
        newNode.prev = current; // Set previous pointer
    }

    display() {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current) {
            process.stdout.write(current.data + " <-> ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        console.log("null");
    }
}
```

## 3. Circular Singly Linked List

### Structure:
- **Node Structure**: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the head, creating a circular structure.

```plaintext
Node
  ├── Data
  └── Pointer to Next Node
```
*The last node's next pointer points to the head node.*

### Characteristics:
- **Circular Structure**: There is no null reference at the end; the list wraps around to the head.
- **No End**: Continuous traversal is possible without reaching a null pointer.

### Advantages:
- Allows for a continuous loop over the list, useful for applications that require circular traversal.

### Disadvantages:
- More complex to manage pointers to prevent infinite loops during traversal.

### Use Cases:
- Implementing round-robin scheduling algorithms.
- Applications that require cyclic traversal, like game systems.

### Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
class CircularListNode {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null; // Pointer to next node
    }
}

class CircularLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null; // Start of the list
    }

    append(data) {
        const newNode = new CircularListNode(data);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            newNode.next = this.head; // Point to itself
            return;
        }
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next !== this.head) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
        newNode.next = this.head; // Complete the circular link
    }

    display() {
        if (!this.head) return;
        let current = this.head;
        do {
            process.stdout.write(current.data + " -> ");
            current = current.next;
        } while (current !== this.head);
        console.log("(head)");
    }
}
```

## 4. Circular Doubly Linked List

### Structure:
- **Node Structure**: Each node contains three components like a doubly linked list but with the last node pointing back to the head and the head pointing back to the last node.

```plaintext
Node
  ├── Pointer to Previous Node
  ├── Data
  └── Pointer to Next Node
```
*The last node's next pointer points to the head node, and the head's previous pointer points to the last node.*

### Characteristics:
- **Bidirectional and Circular**: Allows traversal in both directions with a circular structure.

### Advantages:
- Combines the benefits of both doubly and circular linked lists, allowing for efficient bidirectional traversal and circular looping.

### Disadvantages:
- More complex to implement due to managing both next and previous pointers.

### Use Cases:
- Implementing advanced data structures such as deques or caches.
- Applications requiring bidirectional traversal with a circular structure.

### Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
class CircularDoublyListNode {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null; // Pointer to next node
        this.prev = null; // Pointer to previous node
    }
}

class CircularDoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null; // Start of the list
    }

    append(data) {
        const newNode = new CircularDoublyListNode(data);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            newNode.next = newNode; // Point to itself
            newNode.prev = newNode; // Point to itself
            return;
        }
        let tail = this.head.prev; // Get the last node
        tail.next = newNode;
        newNode.prev = tail; // Set previous pointer
        newNode.next = this.head; // Complete the circular link
        this.head.prev = newNode; // Set head's previous to new node
    }

    display() {
        if (!this.head) return;
        let current = this.head;
        do {
            process.stdout.write(current.data + " <-> ");
            current = current.next;
        } while (current !== this.head);
        console.log("(head)");
    }
}
```
